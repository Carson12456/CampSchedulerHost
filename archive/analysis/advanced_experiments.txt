# Advanced Clustering Experiments

## Experiment 3: Day Load Balancing
**Problem:** Tuesday has too many activities
**Solution:** Penalize overloaded days during slot selection

Test: Check if activities distribute more evenly

## Experiment 4: ODS + Tower Clustering
**Problem:** ODS (Orienteering, GPS, etc.) spreads across 4 days
**Solution:** Cluster ODS with Tower days (they're geographically paired)

Test: Do ODS activities concentrate on Tower days?

## Experiment 5: Aggressive Post-Optimization
**Problem:** After scheduling, some activities could swap for better clustering
**Solution:** More aggressive swap checking in optimization phase

Test: Does it reduce day spread further?

## Current Baseline (After Experiments 1-2)
- Tower: 4 days (Mon:2, Tue:3, Wed:3, Thu:2)
- Archery: 5 days (Mon:3, Tue:3, others single)
- Rifle: 5 days combined
- Max staff: 13
