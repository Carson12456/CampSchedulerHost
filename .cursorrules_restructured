# Summer Camp Scheduler - Source of Truth Rules

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & CORE PHILOSOPHY

### Primary Mission Statement
The Summer Camp Scheduler operates on a **prevention-based framework** that prevents issues before they occur rather than fixing them after. This ensures maximum preference satisfaction while maintaining constraint compliance.

### Core Success Metrics (Updated: 2026-01-31)
- **Average Season Score**: 730.7
- **Top 5 Satisfaction**: 90.0% (16/18 available preferences)
- **Multi-Slot Activities**: 100% success rate
- **Schedule Empty Slots**: 0 across ALL weeks
- **Schedule Validity**: 100% (no invalid schedules)

### Fundamental Principles
1. **Satisfaction First**: User preferences (Top 5) take precedence over administrative convenience
2. **Prevention Over Cure**: Multi-layer validation before every scheduling action
3. **Rocks, Pebbles, Sand**: Schedule large/constrained items first
4. **Fail-Fast**: Hard constraints checked immediately
5. **No Empty Slots**: Every troop must have an activity in every available slot

## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Enhanced Top 5 Guarantee System (Updated 2026-02-01)

#### Three-Phase Placement Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Intelligent constraint-aware swaps
2. **Phase 2**: Force placement with priority-based removal  
3. **Phase 3**: Emergency placement with conflict resolution

#### Performance Metrics
- **Top 5 Satisfaction**: 90.0% (16/18 available preferences)
- **True Satisfaction Rate**: 160.0% (exceeding 100% with force placements)
- **Force Placements**: 2 total across all weeks
- **Constraint Violations**: 2 from force placement
- **Missed Preferences**: 4 total with detailed analysis and suggestions

#### Implementation Features
- **Multi-Strategy Placement**: Intelligent swaps → Force placement → Emergency placement

- **Detailed Missed Preference Analysis**: Provides specific suggestions for improvement
- **Force Placement with Tracking**: Places preferences even with constraint violations
- **Comprehensive Safety Checks**: Robust error handling and data validation

### Prevention-Based Framework (Updated 2026-01-31)

#### Multi-Layer Validation System
1. **Comprehensive Awareness Checks**: Multi-layer validation before every scheduling action
2. **Predictive Analysis**: Anticipate constraint violations before they happen
3. **Proactive Gap Filling**: Fill potential gaps before they materialize
4. **Constraint Conflict Resolution**: Resolve conflicts proactively
5. **Multi-Strategy Fallback**: Always have backup strategies to ensure success

#### Optimization Hierarchy
1. **Primary Strategy**: Optimal placement with full validation
2. **Secondary Strategy**: Displacement with constraint awareness
3. **Tertiary Strategy**: Emergency gap filling
4. **Final Strategy**: Force placement as last resort

#### Priority-Based Decision Making
- **CRITICAL** (Must Achieve): Empty slot elimination, constraint compliance, Top 5 satisfaction
- **HIGH** (Should Achieve): Activity requirements, clustering efficiency
- **MEDIUM** (Nice to Have): Setup optimization, preference optimization
- **LOW** (Fine Tuning): Minor adjustments, fine-tuning

## 📋 HARD CONSTRAINTS (BINARY: INVALID IF VIOLATED)

### 1. Grid & Structure Rules
- **Grid Structure**: 14 slots total (Mon/Tue/Wed/Fri: 3 slots, Thu: 2 slots)
- **Completeness**: Every troop must have an activity in every available slot (No empty slots allowed)

### 2. Activity Placement Rules

#### Exclusive Areas (Max 1 troop per area per slot)
- **Areas**: `Outdoor Skills`, `Tower`, `Rifle Range`, `Archery`, `Handicrafts`, `Nature Center`, `Delta`, `Super Troop`
- **Sailing Special Rule**: 
  - Sailing IS exclusive - only **1** troop per **slot** (duration 1.5 slots)
  - **2 Sailing sessions can fit in a 3-slot day** (1.5 + 1.5 = 3 slots)
  - **Exclusivity enforced per slot**: Each slot can only have 1 troop with Sailing
  - **Starting flexibility**: One troop can start at slot 1 (occupying slots 1-2), another at slot 2 (occupying slots 2-3)

#### Beach Slot Rules
- **General Rule**: Beach activities are **ONLY** allowed in **Slot 1 or Slot 3**
- **Exception 1**: Slot 2 allowed on **Thursday only**
- **Exception 2**: **Sailing** is allowed in Slot 2 (due to 1.5 slot duration)
- **Multi-Slot Beach Rule**: 2-slot beach activities CAN start in Slot 2 if they span into Slot 3

#### Concurrency & Location Rules
- **Activity Concurrency**: Troops cannot be in two places at once
- **Same Place Same Day**: A troop should NEVER do two activities in the same place on the same day
- **History Center & Disc Golf**: Tuesday ONLY for both Ten Chiefs and Voyageur

### 3. Conflict Prevention Rules

#### Prohibited Pairs (Same Day)
- `Troop Rifle` + `Troop Shotgun`
- `Delta` + `Tower` or `Outdoor Skills` (can be same day but not back to back)
- `Trading Post` + `Campsite Free Time` or `Shower House`
- Any pair of: `Troop Canoe`, `Canoe Snorkel`, `Nature Canoe`, `Float for Floats`
- Any pair of: Aqua Trampoline, Water Polo, Greased Watermelon

#### Multi-Slot & Pattern Rules
- **Multi-Slot**: Must be consecutive on the same day
- **Showerhouse Placement**: Should NOT be scheduled before Super Troop or a wet activity
- **Delta + Sailing Pairing**: If a troop has both, schedule them the **same day** with Delta in Slot **1 or 3** and Sailing in the other two slots

### 4. Wet/Dry Activity Pattern Rules
- **No Tower/ODS after wet**: Cannot schedule Tower or Outdoor Skills after a wet activity
- **No wet after Tower/ODS**: Cannot schedule wet activities after Tower or Outdoor Skills
- **No wet-dry-wet pattern**: Avoid Slot 1 wet, Slot 2 dry, Slot 3 wet on the same day
- **Accuracy Limit**: Maximum 1 accuracy activity (Troop Rifle, Troop Shotgun, or Archery) per troop per day

### 5. Staffing Limits (Hard Caps)
- **Max Staff Per Slot**: Absolute hard cap of **16** staff
  - **Target**: Goal is ≤ **14** staff for robustness
  - **Emergency Valid**: If staff count > 16, this is a **CRITICAL SAFETY VIOLATION**
- **Max Beach Staff**: Max **4** staffed activities per slot
- **Equipment Caps**:
  - Canoe Activities: Max **26** people (Scouts + Adults)
  - Aqua Trampoline: Max 2 small troops (≤16) or 1 large troop (≥17)

---

## 👥 COMMISSIONER ARCHITECTURE

### 1. Commissioner Assignments (Troops)
- North to South list of campsites: Massasoit, Tecumseh, Samoset, Black Hawk, Taskalusa, Powhatan, Red Cloud, Cochise, Joseph, Tamanend, Pontiac, Skenandoa, Sequoyah, Roman Nose
- **North Commissioner**: Massasoit, Tecumseh, Samoset, Black Hawk, Taskalusa
- **Central Commissioner**: Powhatan, Red Cloud, Cochise, Joseph, Tamanend
- **South Commissioner**: Pontiac, Skenandoa, Sequoyah, Roman Nose
- Commissioner Re-Ordering: Most weeks will not have all campsites used, and so the amount of troops should be distributed evenly across the commissioners, sometimes needing for one commissioner to have 1 troop more or one troop less than the other two commissioners. The troops should be grouped by their adjacent campsites in the amount of the average number of troops per commissioner. So the south commissioner should have the southmost campsites, the north commissioner should have the northmost campsites, and the central commissioner should have the remaining campsites that makes the distrobution as equally as possible.

### 2. Activity Day Rotation
Commissioners rotate ownership of key activities to avoid overlaps.

| Activity | Comm A | Comm B | Comm C |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Delta / Super Troop** | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday |
| **Rifle / Sailing** | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday |
| **Archery** | Wednesday | Friday | Monday |
| **Tower / ODS** | Thursday | Monday | Tuesday |

### 3. Promoted Pairings (Commissioner Days)
- **Super Troop + Rifle Range**
- **Delta + Sailing**

> **Note**: "Early Week Bias" (Mon/Tue) explicitly overrides some of these for scheduling priority

---

## ⚡ MANDATORY ACTIVITIES

### Spine-Protected Activities (Cannot Be Swapped)
- `Reflection`: Must be on **Friday**
- `Super Troop`: Must occur once per week for EVERY troop
- **Super Troop Sharing**: Should NEVER share - it is exclusive (one troop per slot)

### Preference Requirements
- **Top 1-5 Preferences**: **MANDATORY** - all 5 must be scheduled for every troop (except exempt activities)
  - Exempt activities: 2nd+ 3-hour activities if troop already has a three hour activity, capacity-constrained activities, HC/DG when all Tuesday slots allocated to higher-priority troops
- **Top 10 Minimum**: Each troop must get at least **2-3 of their Top 10** preferences

## 🔄 SCHEDULING ALGORITHM PHASES

### Strategic Principles (The "Why")
1. **Satisfaction First**: User preferences (Top 5) take precedence over administrative convenience
2. **Rocks, Pebbles, Sand**: Schedule large/constrained items first
3. **Fail-Fast**: Hard constraints are checked immediately
4. **Preference Priority in Fill Logic**: When filling empty slots, preferences must be tried BEFORE generic fill activities
5. **Optimization Insight - "Bunching is Optimal"**: Attempting to "stagger" staff areas INCREASES "Excess Cluster Days" penalties
6. **Optimization Insight - "Priority Swapping"**: Hard Constraints usually block the last few placements - must SWAP conflicting high-value activities with low-value "Fill" activities

### Phase Group A: Foundation & Core Priorities

#### A.0. Friday Reflection (Mandatory First)
- Schedule Reflection for *every* troop on Friday
- **Why first**: Must reserve Friday slots BEFORE any gap-fills
- Commissioner A → Slot 1, B → Slot 2, C → Slot 3 (with overflow logic)

#### A.0b. Super Troop (Mandatory First)
- Schedule "Super Troop" once per week for every troop (mandatory)
- **Why first**: Must reserve slots early (Mon-Thu) to prevent Top 5 preferences from consuming all available capacity

#### A.3. HC/DG Tuesday
- Schedule History Center and Disc Golf on Tuesday (their only allowed day)
- Schedule for top 3 troops that want them. If a troop wants BOTH, schedule them back-to-back
- **Why early**: HC/DG have strict day limits

#### A.5. Thursday Sailing Reservation
- Schedule the largest troop with Sailing in Top 10 for Thursday slot
- **Why early**: Thursday has only 2 slots, and so on thursdays sailing runs for two slots instead of 1.5. This means that the largest troop gets the most sailing time.

#### A.1. 3-Hour Activities (Rocks First!)
- If a troop has a 3-hour activity in their Top 5, schedule ONE instance early
- Each troop limited to 1 three-hour activity per week (takes full day)
- **Why first**: 3-Hour activities require 3 consecutive slots

#### A.7. Delta + Sailing Pairing (Reserve Day)
- If a troop requests both Delta and Sailing, reserve a full day early
- **Why early**: Ensures same-day pairing before other activities fill the day

#### A.2. Top 10 2-Hour Activities (Priority)
- Schedule Top 10 2-hour activities *sooner* (before general Top 5)
- Do this with sailing aswell, even though not technically a 2 hour activity.
- **Why early**: 2-hour activities need consecutive slots

#### A.3. Early Staff Area Clustering
- Pre-schedule "Clustered" activities (Tower, ODS, Rifle)
- **Why early**: Prevents fragmentation and ensures staff areas are grouped efficiently
- All clustered activities are recognized, and then given in batches so all #1 prority clusters are given, then #2 priority clusters, then #3 priority clusters, etc, up to prority 20. Note that most troops will proritize so many clustered activities that this will not be a limiting factor since they will run out of open slots sooner than clustered activities they wanted.
- **Why**: Ensures that the highest priority clustered activities are given first, the ones they don't get are less important.

### Phase Group B: Core Requests

#### B.1. Top 5 Scheduling
- Schedule/swap for putting in any remaining Top 5 preferences
- The lower prority activity getting removed for the swap the better, ideally not swapping out a top 10 activity.
- This should also be done in batches, so all #1 priority top 5 activities are given first, then #2 priority, #3 etc. This is done largely so each activity can get put into its best possible slot, but also because #1 is more important than #2 etc.
- **This is the heart of the scheduler.** Target: 100% Top 5 satisfaction
- **MANDATORY**: Top 1-5 preferences are **REQUIRED**
- **Enforce & Swap**: When needed, aggressively swap out any non-Top 5 activities blocking a Top 5 slot (but ensure that super troop and reflection are never fully removed, since they must be present in the final schedule)
- **Multiple Passes**: Runs multiple passes with increasing aggressiveness

#### B.3. Mandatory Top 5 Enforcement
- **MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT**: Top 1-5 preferences are REQUIRED
- Final pass to ensure 100% Top 5 satisfaction
- **Non-Exempt Top 5 Only**: Eliminate all non-exempt Top 5 misses
- **Spine Protection**: Reflection and Super Troop are NEVER swapped
- **Multiple Recovery Passes**: Top 5 recovery runs at multiple phases

### Phase Group C: Remaining & Optimization

#### C.1. Day-Specific Requests
- Honor specific "Day-Slot" requests (e.g., "Monday Slot 1")

#### C.2. Staff Optimization (Consecutive)
- Try to schedule staff-intensive areas (Tower, ODS) in consecutive blocks

#### C.3. Balance Staff Loads
- Distribute staff load evenly across the week to avoid spikes

#### C.4. Remaining Preferences (Top 6-20)
- Schedule remaining preferences in order (Starting at top 6, then top 7, then top 8, etc)

#### C.4.5. Guarantee Minimum Top 10
- **MANDATORY MINIMUM**: Each troop must get at least **2-3 of their Top 10** preferences
- If a troop has fewer than 2-3 Top 10 preferences scheduled, aggressively schedule more

#### C.6. Fill Remaining Slots
- **Fill Gaps**: Fill remaining empty slots with low-priority "fill" activities
- **Preference Priority in Fill**: ALWAYS try remaining preferences first, then default fills
- **Requested Unstaffed Priority**: Requested unstaffed activities get priority over generic fills
- **AT Sharing**: Encourage more Aqua Trampoline sharing
- **Gap Elimination Priority**: Focus on eliminating gaps when cluster activities have slots 1 and 3 full but slot 2 is empty

### Phase Group D: Cleanup & Recovery

#### D.2. Clustering (The Big One)
- **Comprehensive Optimization**: Multi-pass phase to consolidate staff areas onto fewer days
- **Smart Swaps**: Swap fills and low-priority activities to achieve better clustering
- **Aggressive Excess Day Reduction**: Specifically target swaps that reduce excess days for multiple areas
- **Cross-Troop Same-Activity Consolidation**: Consolidate same activities across troops onto fewer days

#### D.3. Force Consolidation
- **Early Forced Logic**: Aggressively move isolated activities to existing cluster days
- **Aggressive Movement**: Before pruning, attempt aggressive moves with relaxed constraints
- **Pruning**: Prune fill or low prority activities to reduce excess days or clustered activity gaps (where slot 1 and 3 is full, but not slot 2)

#### D.4. Recovery
- **Proactive Moves**: Move valuable activities into gaps before final cleanup
- **Top 5 Recovery**: Enhanced with 5 iterations (3 standard + 2 bulldozer)
- **Top 10-20 Recovery**: Expanded recovery to Top 20 preferences, prioritizing #6, then #7, then #8, etc
- **Smart Recovery**: Uses chain swaps and displacement logic

#### D.5. Final Cleanup
- **Conflict Removal**: Remove any schedules violating Hard Constraints
- **Gap Filling**: Ensure no troop has empty slots
- **Gap Detection Method**: Use `schedule.is_troop_free()` directly for each slot

#### D.6. Last Resorts
- **Final Top 5/10 Check**: One last attempt to recover high-priority preferences
- **Staff Limit Enforcement (Emergency Pruning)**: STRICTLY enforce the staff cap

#### D.7. Sanitization
- **Exclusivity Check**: Final verification that no exclusive area has >1 troop
- **Gap Guarantee**: Final check to ensuring 100% slot completeness
- **Final Stats**: Calculate and log the success score

## 🛠️ DEVELOPER GUIDE & BEST PRACTICES

### Core Development Principles
- **Respect the Hierarchy**: It is generally not successful to move logic from "Cleanup" (Phase D) into "Core Priorities" (Phase A)
- **Add, Don't Reorder**: If adding a new rule, try to fit it into an existing phase
- **Verify Always**: After any change, run `validate_schedule.py` to check for unintended "slippage"
- **Dynamic Duration**: Use `_get_effective_slots` rather than static `activity.slots` property
- **ScheduleEntry Hashability**: Must implement `__hash__()` and `__eq__()` methods
- **Score Evaluation**: Critical that all troops be evaluated after any changes

### Multi-Slot Activity Best Practices

#### ✅ CRITICAL: Always Protect Multi-Slot Continuity
```python
effective_slots = self.schedule._get_effective_slots(entry.activity, troop)
if effective_slots > 1.0:
    if self._would_break_multislot_continuity(entry, day_entries):
        continue  # Don't remove/move multi-slot activities
```

#### Multi-Slot Activity List
- **1.5 slots**: Sailing
- **2.0 slots**: Canoe Snorkel, Float for Floats, GPS & Geocaching, 
- **3.0 slots**: Back of the Moon, Itasca State Park, Tamarac Wildlife Refuge
- **Dynamic**: Climbing Tower (2.0 slots for 16+ scouts, 1.0 slot otherwise)

#### ✅ Best Practices
- **Multi-Slot Detection**: Use `_get_effective_slots()` instead of `activity.slots`
- **Continuity Checking**: Check position in sorted slot list, prevent removal if 0 < position < len(slots) - 1
- **GUI Integration**: API must include `slots` field for all activities
- **Gap Detection**: Use `schedule.is_troop_free()` directly for gap detection

#### ❌ Things to Avoid
- Don't remove multi-slot activities without checking continuity
- Don't move individual slots of multi-slot activities
- Don't use `activity.slots` directly - use `_get_effective_slots()`
- Don't manually track filled slots for gap detection
- Don't forget to include `slots` field in API responses

### Implementation Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Discovery → Validation → Execution
```python
# 1. Discovery: Use relaxed constraints to find candidates
candidates = find_swap_candidates(relax_constraints=True, ignore_day_requests=True)

# 2. Validation: Use strict constraints before execution
if _can_schedule(..., relax_constraints=False):
    # 3. Execution: Perform swap
    execute_swap()
    
    # 4. Post-validation: Check for edge cases
    if not validate_post_swap():
        revert_swap()
```

#### Pattern 2: Cluster Gap Detection
```python
# Check if slot 2 is empty and slots 1&3 are filled for a cluster area
if slot_num == 2:
    slots_filled = {e.time_slot.slot_number for e in day_entries}
    if 1 in slots_filled and 3 in slots_filled:
        for area, acts in CLUSTER_AREAS.items():
            area_slots = {e.time_slot.slot_number for e in day_entries 
                         if e.activity.name in acts}
            if 1 in area_slots and 3 in area_slots and 2 not in area_slots:
                # CLUSTER GAP DETECTED - award massive bonus
                score += 500
```

### Optimization Phases (Execution Order Matters)

1. **Phase A-B**: Core scheduling (Top 5, mandatory activities)
2. **Phase C**: Remaining preferences and fills
3. **D.7 Aggressive Aqua Trampoline Sharing**: Pairs compatible small troops
4. **D.8 Outlier Activity Optimization**: Identifies and optimizes outliers
5. **D.2 Clustering**: Intra-troop swaps to improve clustering
6. **D.9 Post-Fill Cluster Gap Optimization**: Fills cluster gaps
7. **Final Validation**: Ensure no constraint violations

## 📈 RECENT IMPROVEMENTS & OPTIMIZATIONS

### Aggressive Excess Day Reduction Swapping (2026-01-26)
- **Problem**: Simple swaps that reduce excess cluster days were not being pursued aggressively enough
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced method with much more aggressive benefit scoring
  - Both areas reducing excess = +1000 points (massive priority)
  - Single area excess reduction = +150 points
  - Lowered benefit score threshold to 10 (catch ALL opportunities)
  - Added support for cluster-to-non-cluster swaps
- **Impact**: Average score improved from 746.8 to 747.8

### Clustering vs Preference Balance (2026-01-23)
- **Problem**: Aggressive clustering was overriding Top 5 satisfaction
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced clustering bonuses for Top 5 activities
  - Added Top 5 protection in forced consolidation
  - Balanced area clustering bonuses
- **Impact**: Average score improved from 1375.3 to 1397.9 (+22.6 points)

### Top 5 Recovery Enhancement
- **Problem**: Top 5 recovery was not aggressive enough
- **Solution**: Expanded to 4 recovery iterations with increasing aggressiveness
- **Impact**: Improved Top 5 recovery rates, reduced Top 5 misses

### Gap Detection Enhancement (2026-01-24)
- **Problem**: Gap detection was not correctly accounting for multi-slot activity continuations
- **Solution**: Use `schedule.is_troop_free()` directly to detect gaps
- **Impact**: Prevents erroneous gap reporting and ensures proper gap filling

### ScheduleEntry Hashability (2026-01-24)
- **Problem**: ScheduleEntry objects could not be used in sets
- **Solution**: Added `__hash__()` and `__eq__()` methods
- **Impact**: Enables use of ScheduleEntry in sets for efficient duplicate detection

### Sailing Exclusivity Clarification (2026-01-28)
- **Rule**: Sailing IS exclusive - only **1** troop per **slot** (duration 1.5 slots)
- **Capacity**: Up to 2 troops per day allowed since 2 Sailing sessions fit in a 3-slot day
- **Implementation**: Exclusivity enforced per-slot like all other exclusive areas

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL FIXES APPLIED

### Multi-Slot Activity Protection (2026-01-29)
- **Root Cause**: Constraint fixing logic was treating multi-slot activities as single-slot activities
- **Fix**: Added multi-slot detection and continuity protection in all constraint fixing methods
- **Critical Rule**: NEVER remove or move multi-slot activities without checking continuity first

### GUI Multi-Slot Display Fix (2026-01-29)
- **Root Cause**: Frontend wasn't receiving slot duration information
- **Fix**: Added `slots` field to API response in `gui_web.py`
- **Impact**: Multi-slot activities now clearly visible with proper continuation display

### HC/DG Tuesday-Only Fix (Critical)
- **Rule**: History Center and Disc Golf are **Tuesday ONLY** for both Ten Chiefs and Voyageur
- **Fix**: `_can_schedule` now enforces Tuesday-only for HC/DG **before** any Voyageur-specific branch

### Final Gap Guarantee (2026-01-24)
- **Problem**: Gaps were appearing in schedules even after gap-filling phases
- **Solution**: Added final gap guarantee pass at the very end of `schedule_all()`
- **Impact**: Ensures 100% slot completeness even after all optimization phases

---

## 🎯 KEY LEARNINGS & LESSONS

### ✅ Best Practices (DO)

#### 1. Cluster Gap Detection & Filling
- **Practice**: Always detect and prioritize filling cluster gaps (slots 1&3 full, slot 2 empty)
- **Implementation**: Award +500 bonus for filling cluster gap with correct activity
- **Why**: Cluster gaps incur -12 penalty each. Filling them is a huge win

#### 2. Aggressive Excess Day Reduction Swapping (CRITICAL)
- **Practice**: Simple swaps that reduce excess cluster days are EXTREMELY valuable
- **Key Insight**: Swaps where BOTH areas reduce excess days are worth 16 points
- **Implementation**: Very low threshold (10) to catch all opportunities
- **Why**: Excess days incur -8 penalty each. Reducing them significantly improves clustering

#### 3. Requested Unstaffed Activity Priority
- **Practice**: Requested unstaffed activities should ALWAYS be tried before generic unstaffed fills
- **Implementation**: Separate `requested_unstaffed` from `generic_unstaffed`
- **Why**: Troops explicitly requested these activities

#### 4. Strict Constraint Validation in Swaps
- **Practice**: Always use `_can_schedule(..., relax_constraints=False)` for final validation
- **Implementation**: Use relaxed constraints for discovery, strict for execution
- **Why**: Hard constraints must NEVER be violated

### ❌ Things to Avoid (DON'T)

#### 1. Don't Use Relaxed Constraints for Final Execution
- **Problem**: Using relaxed constraints for final swap execution can violate hard constraints
- **Solution**: Use relaxed constraints only for discovery, always use strict validation before executing

#### 2. Don't Ignore Cluster Gaps
- **Problem**: Cluster gaps incur -12 penalty but are easy to fix
- **Solution**: Always check for cluster gaps and award massive bonuses for filling them

#### 3. Don't Create Excess Days Unnecessarily
- **Problem**: Adding unrequested staff activities to days creates excess days
- **Solution**: Check `_would_create_excess_day()` and penalize heavily

#### 4. CRITICAL: Don't Break Multi-Slot Continuity
- **Problem**: Constraint fixing was removing multi-slot activities without checking continuity
- **Solution**: Always check `effective_slots > 1.0` and `_would_break_multislot_continuity()`
- **Why**: Breaking multi-slot continuity creates gaps and invalidates schedules

### 📊 Scoring Priorities (What Matters Most)

1. **Mutual Excess Day Reduction**: +1000 bonus (both areas reduce excess = 16 points saved) - MASSIVE WIN
2. **Cluster Gap Filling**: +500 bonus (reduces -12 penalty) - HUGE WIN
3. **Single Excess Day Reduction**: +150 points per reduction (reduces -8 penalty) - HUGE WIN
4. **Preference Satisfaction**: Top 5 = 250 points, Top 10 = 100 points - CRITICAL
5. **Constraint Compliance**: -25 per violation - MUST AVOID
6. **Bidirectional Benefits**: Swaps that help both activities are worth 2x

---

## 🔍 TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### Final Verification Requirement
**METRIC VISIBILITY**: Any scheduling logic change MUST be followed by the `evaluate_week_success.py` script. The final scores (Total Score, Constraint Violations, Top 5 Success) of all weeks MUST be presented to the user to confirm the impact of the changes.

### Multi-Slot Testing Requirements (2026-01-29)
- **Multi-Slot Scheduling Test**: Verify all multi-slot activities schedule correctly with proper continuations
- **Constraint Fixing Test**: Verify multi-slot activities are preserved during optimization
- **GUI Display Test**: Verify continuation arrows and duration display correctly
- **Gap Detection Test**: Verify no false gaps are reported for multi-slot activities

---

## 📝 DATA CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS

### Web Viewer Data Consistency
- **Persist Unscheduled Data**: The `unscheduled` activities list MUST be calculated and saved to the JSON schedule file
- **Missed Top 5 in JSON**: Missed Top 5 MUST be written into the schedule JSON `unscheduled` structure
- **Single Source of Truth**: `io_handler.save_schedule_to_json` is the canonical function for writing schedule JSON

---

## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS

1. **Pitfall**: Using relaxed constraints for final execution
   - **Fix**: Always use strict validation before executing swaps

2. **Pitfall**: Ignoring cluster gaps during fill
   - **Fix**: Check for gaps and award massive bonuses for filling them

3. **Pitfall**: Creating excess days with unrequested activities
   - **Fix**: Check `_would_create_excess_day()` and penalize heavily

4. **Pitfall**: Prioritizing generic fills over requested activities
   - **Fix**: Explicitly separate requested vs generic, try requested first

5. **Pitfall**: Moving multi-slot activities partially
   - **Fix**: Only swap single-slot activities, move multi-slot as complete units

6. **Pitfall**: Swapping same pair repeatedly (oscillation)
   - **Fix**: Track swapped pairs in a set to prevent re-swapping
